Building BUDGR, my personal budgeting and financial reporting tool 

## What does Budger do?
Budgr brings transaction data from all my financial accounts into one place using Plaid, giving me a clean, unified ledger. It helps me build budgets based on actual spending habits and sends me daily email updates on how I'm tracking against goals.
